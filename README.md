# Todo App

### Problem Statement
#### Objective

- Develop a basic Windows/Desktop application that allows users to manage a Todo list. The application should have the following features:

    1. A screen to display existing tasks in a list format.
    2. An option to add a new task with a title and description.
    3. Ability to mark tasks as completed or delete them.
    4. Basic data persistence (local storage is sufficient for this test).

#### Requirements
    1. Use C# programming language and WPF framework for Windows/Desktop application development.
    2. Implement MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.
    3. Use ListView or DataGrid for displaying tasks.
    4. Use JSON file or SQLite for data persistence.
    5. Implement proper error handling and input validation.

## Run Locally

To run the provided code locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Royalaviation18/ToDo-App
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd ToDo-App-master
```

- Open the Project in Visual Studio: Once you have the code on your local machine, open the project in Visual Studio. You can do this by navigating to the directory where the repository was cloned or extracted, and opening the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio.
- Build the Solution: In Visual Studio, build the solution by selecting "Build" > "Build Solution" from the menu. This will compile the code and resolve any dependencies.

- Run the Application: After the solution has been successfully built, you can run the application by selecting "Debug" > "Start Debugging" from the menu, or by pressing F5. This will start the application, and you should see the Todo application window appear.

- Interact with the Application: Once the application is running, you can interact with it just like any other Windows/Desktop application. You can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and so on.
